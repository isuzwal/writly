          <p className="text-lg leading-8 mb-4">
            Writly began as more than just a coding project — it was a journey of learning and building from the ground up. With curiosity and a clear goal, I set out to create a full-stack blogging platform where ideas could be shared freely and beautifully.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-8 mb-4">
            Along the way, I dived deep into how APIs work, how routes interact with components, and how backend logic like authentication, CRUD operations, and database modeling shape the core of every modern app.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-8 mb-4">
            Every feature — from posting blogs to managing profiles, from following users to securing data — was built with care, debugged with patience, and polished through real experience. It’s not perfect, but it’s proof that progress is possible when you’re hands-on with code.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-8">
            Writly is still growing — just like me. And this is just the beginning.
